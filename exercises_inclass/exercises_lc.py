# List comprehension

 # [expression for item in iterable (if condition)]
    # 1) expression: expresion to evaluate and append to the new list
    # 2) item: the variable representing each element in the iterable (e.g., a list, tuple, or string).
    # 3) iterable: the sequence or iterable to iterate over
    # 4) condition (optional): An expression to filter elements based on a condition.

# The expression is the current item in the iteration but also the outcome which can 
# be manipulated before it is added to the new list
# The condition is like a filter that only accepts the items that valuate to True.

#Return a list of composers with a certain letter('v') in the name

# 2) Render the above function as a list comprehension
